									<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
									<p>My great-grandma is a poet. Through her words, I learned that writing can uncover feelings we are unable to perceive. And so, whenever I feel an emotion that implores comprehension, I explore it through writing. These poems haven’t been written in a day or two, they have taken hours to mature. Days. Months. Four years, to be exact. On notebooks. Post-its. Napkins. They’ve been written in different situations. While looking at the ocean. While having oceans in my eyes. When my chest felt warm. And when I only had my hands to hold my pieces together. Words jump through my fingers as if they had a mind of their own. And whenever my heart asks me to write, I do. Although some poems have been untouched for years, I believe that all the emotions I once felt are valid. That all emotions are. And hence, they should be embraced. </p>

									<h2 class="major">@poemsbyanto</h2>
									<p>I created this Instagram with the idea of spreading rawness and empowerment. With the goal of challenging myself and sharing my emotions. All I want is for my poems to let others know that it is ok to break and melt and cry. That it is ok to love deeply. To care. To be passionate. That it is not only ok but courageous to be vulnerable in a world that demands us to be cold. That emotions should be felt deeply and not neglected, as they are our greatest teachers. I hope some of my words resonate with you :)</p>

									<h2 class="major">VulnerabiliTea</h2>
									<p>I created  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17856434095961786/">VulnerabiliTea Week</a> with the intent of spreading the idea that being vulnerable isn’t as scary as it seemed. I wanted to start a chain of positivity and vulnerability. The  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17856248578941481/">answers</a> were beautiful. People opened their hearts and minds and there was so much connection and growth.
"The more we can connect with ourselves, the more we'll be able to connect with others. This will be a reflective and exciting challenge that will remind us of the importance of being raw. Vulnerable. And I invite you to join me.
There will be three questions each day involving a specific topic (gratitude, forgiveness, resilience, etc.) and I will be answering them too.
If you would like to take a step further and challenge yourself even more, you can share your answer by tagging me and using the hashtag #VulnerabiliTeaWeek, by responding to the question on my story, or by sending it to me.
I encourage you to share your thoughts with the world, our words are a powerful tool when it comes to manifesting our reality.
Love,
anto.</p>
